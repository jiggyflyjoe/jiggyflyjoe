## Hi there 👋

**jiggyflyjoe**, or just **Joe**, is a tech-obsessed, introverted, diabetic, and “neurospicy” creative who swapped the city lights of Indianapolis for the quiet charm of rural Kansas—where the sunsets are gorgeous, but the internet speed is a humbling experience. A former Software Development and Visual Communications student turned coding and **tech enthusiast**, Joe spends his days deep-diving into software, web development, and gaming tech, always chasing that next great project.

When he's not wrangling code, Joe wears many hats—gamer, writer, live streamer, podcaster, photographer, and graphic artist. His **Twitch streams** are a cozy, welcoming escape from the chaos of the world, fostering community and connection through good vibes and great games. But his most devoted audience? His feline trio: **Tigger**, **Rufus**, and **Cinnamon**, who ensure he never codes too long without a mandatory cuddle (or an impromptu keyboard takeover).

Looking ahead, Joe is focused on leveling up his skills, launching creative projects, and building toward a career that blends his love of **tech**, **gaming**, and **storytelling**. Whether he's crafting content, developing software, or just sharing a laugh online, his mission remains the same—bringing light, creativity, and a sense of belonging to the digital world.
