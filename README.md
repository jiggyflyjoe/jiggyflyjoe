## Hi there 👋

**jiggyflyjoe**, or simply **Joe**, is an introverted and “neurospicy” Type 2 diabetic hailing from Indianapolis who’s traded city life for the wide-open skies of rural Kansas. While the sunsets are stunning, the internet speed reminds him to stay humble. A former Software Development and Visual Communications student, Joe has embraced self-learning, diving headfirst into software, web development, and programming as a passionate tech enthusiast.

Outside of tech, Joe is a multifaceted creative: gamer, writer, live streamer, podcaster, photographer, and graphic artist. His Twitch streams radiate good vibes and foster a peaceful, welcoming community—an extension of his mission to create spaces for connection and camaraderie. Joe’s most loyal supporters, however, are his three fluffy feline companions: Tigger, Rufus, and Cinnamon. They remind him daily that even coding geniuses need to pause for a cuddle (or the occasional laser pointer chase).

As he looks ahead to 2025, Joe is excited to continue growing his skills, building creative projects, and working toward his ultimate dream: a fulfilling career in the tech or gaming industries, while curating light and love in an increasingly chaotic world.
