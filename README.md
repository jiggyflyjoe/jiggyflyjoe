## Hi there 👋

<!--
**jiggyflyjoe/jiggyflyjoe** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm **jiggyflyjoe** (or just **Joe**), an Indianapolis native who recently made the bold move to Middle of Nowhere, Kansas, where the tumbleweeds roll and Wi-Fi signals hide. Once a Visual Communications student at the University of Kansas, I'm now on a self-taught journey through the wild world of web/software development and programming. When I'm not fighting bugs (the programming kind, not the Kansas kind), I usually dabble in gaming, writing, live streaming, podcasting, and graphic art. I'm also a proud cat dad to three fluffy overlords: Tigger, Rufus, and Cinnamon. With a love for TV, movies, video games, technology, music, arts, and crafts, I hope to one day take over the tech or gaming world — after my cats approve, of course! 🐾
