## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**jiggyflyjoe/jiggyflyjoe** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm **jiggyflyjoe** (or just Joe, if you prefer). I'm a *very* introverted 39-year-old Indianapolis native who recently relocated to Kansas to be closer to family. I'm a former software development student and *then* a visual communications student at Ivy Tech Community College and the University of Kansas. (It's a long story.) I am now trying to get back to my software and web development roots via self-teaching with internet resources! I have also been known as a gamer, writer, Twitch streamer, podcaster, and graphic artist. I'm *terminally* online. I love TV and film, music, video games, arts and crafts, animals (including my adorable and furry feline babies Tigger, Rufus, and Cinnamon!), and *of course*, just about all kinds of technology and computers.
